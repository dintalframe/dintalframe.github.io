I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working under the guidance of Dr. Abasifreke Ebong. My research focuses on advancing next-generation photovoltaic technologies through a combination of materials innovation and machine learningâ€“driven optimization.

I specialize in developing cost-effective copper metallization strategies for silicon solar cells, improving device performance while reducing dependence on silver. My work integrates materials characterization (XRD, SEM, TEM, AFM, SIMS, Raman) with data-driven modeling and analysis (Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, PyTorch) to uncover insights that guide scalable solar manufacturing.

In addition to research, I have experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, supporting undergraduate and graduate courses in electromagnetics, semiconductors, and electronics. I enjoy mentoring students in both laboratory and classroom settings, helping them connect theory with hands-on engineering practice.

My publications include studies on screen-printable copper pastes, cavitated Ag pastes, carbon-nanotube reinforced contacts, and thin-film photovoltaic trends, presented at major venues such as IEEE PVSC, IEEE HONET, and AIP Advances. Collectively, these works aim to reduce costs, enhance reliability, and accelerate the adoption of sustainable solar technologies.

Beyond photovoltaics, I am passionate about the intersection of machine learning and materials science, exploring how AI can accelerate clean energy innovation.
