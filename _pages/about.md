I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, advised by Dr. Abasifreke Ebong. My research focuses on advancing next-generation photovoltaic technologies through a combination of materials innovation and machine learningâ€“driven optimization.

I specialize in developing cost-effective copper metallization strategies for silicon solar cells, integrating materials characterization with data-driven modeling to improve performance and reduce costs. Alongside my research, I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, mentoring students in electromagnetics, semiconductors, and electronics.

My work has been published and presented at leading venues including IEEE PVSC, IEEE HONET, and AIP Advances, covering solar metallization strategies, nanomaterials integration, and thin-film PV trends.

Research Areas

- Photovoltaic device engineering (silicon and thin-film technologies)

- Metallization strategies (copper, silver, nanomaterials)

- Materials characterization (XRD, SEM, TEM, AFM, SIMS, Raman)

- Machine learning for materials and device optimization

- Data analysis and scientific computing (Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
