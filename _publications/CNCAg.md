title: "The Investigation of the Addition of Surface-engineered Carbon Nanotubes to Ag Thick Film Paste to Improve the Solar Cell Front Gridline Durability"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/CNCAg
excerpt: 'Extending the lifetime of solar cells in a module is one way of reducing the cost of solar electricity. This could be done by incorporating surface-engineered carbon nanotubes (SE-CNTs) into a commercial Ag paste for the front gridlines of a solar cell. This work shows the preliminary results of two sets of samples with and without the SE-CNTs, which confirm that there is no detrimental effect electrically to the cells when SE-CNTs are incorporated. The average efficiency of G1-CZ PERC cells with the SE-CNT incorporated Ag paste was the same to the counterpart commercial paste at~22.3%. This is very promising as the durability of the gridlines is increased; enabling the cells to produce electricity at >80% of its initial capacity for at least 30 years. Thus, by increasing the malleability of the front gridlines to withstand the stress and strain resulting from large temperature gradients, good adhesion to both the Si bulk and ribbon interconnects coupled with high efficiency would make this a dream come true for the PV industry.'

Extending the lifetime of solar cells in a module is one way of reducing the cost of solar electricity.
