permalink: /publication/CavAg1
excerpt: 'This paper reports on the investigation of cavitated silver paste produced by cavitation technology as a cost-effective alternative to traditional three-roll milling. Cavitation, utilizing high-frequency sound waves, enhances metal paste dispersion, reduces oxidation, extends shelf life, and minimizes waste. Passivated emitter and rear cell solar cells made with cavitated silver paste achieved 21% energy conversion efficiency, slightly lower than the 22% efficiency of a conventional paste. A cavitated paste produced finer gridlines, reducing silver usage and costs but increasing contact resistance, leading to a lower fill factor. Despite this, cavitation technology shows promise for more efficient and cost-effective solar cell production. Further research is needed to optimize efficiency and resistance, highlighting the potential for cavitation technology in commercial applications.'
