This talk presents how Laser-Enhanced Contact Optimization (LECO) enables reliable, silver-free copper screen-printed contacts in PERC solar cells. By inducing localized nano-scale Joule heating, LECO forms a stable copper silicide (Cu₃Si) layer at the Cu–Si interface, reducing series resistance threefold and boosting efficiency from 17.9% to 20.4%. The results highlight LECO as a scalable and cost-effective pathway for next-generation photovoltaic metallization.
